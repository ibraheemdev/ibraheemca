**Why should you learn Rust?**

Rust has been getting a lot of media attention recently. It has been [voted the most loved language](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages) for five years running, and is used at many large companies such as Mozilla, Apple, and Microsoft. Why do so many people love Rust?

The short answer is that Rust solves many of the hassles associated with other popular languages. Developers coming from dynamically typed languages will find it hard to argue the benefits of static typing. Static type definitions are even being added to many popular dynamic languages, such as typescript, python type hints, and ruby.
