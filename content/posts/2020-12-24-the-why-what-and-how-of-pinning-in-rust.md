description: With futures and async/await, many people are being exposed to the
  Pin type and its sibling trait Unpin. In this post, we dive deep into what
  these types are, why they are needed, how they work, and how to use them. We
  also dig into the connection to Futures and async/await, as well as potential
  use cases beyond in Futures. We also discuss structural pinning, and how you
  can use pin-project to avoid using unsafe and make your life a little bit
  easier.
