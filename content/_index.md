## Ibraheem Ahmed

I'm Ibraheem. Here's a little bit about me:

I enjoy programming in a variety of languages, most notably Go and Ruby on Rails. I am very active in the Rust community, a language which I work with in my spare time. I also work with frontend technologies like React, Redux, and Typescript.

I love helping other people learn the languages I love, which is why I am active on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/8858995/ibraheem-ahmed?tab=profile) and write weekly at [ibraheem.ca](https://ibraheem.ca/), where you can find tutorials, useful scripts, and other fun explorations.

I open source a lot of my projects, which you can find on [github](https://github.com/ibraheemdev).

I am also open for freelance work. Want to talk about a project you think I can help with? [Let's get in touch!](mailto:ibrah1440@gmail.com)
