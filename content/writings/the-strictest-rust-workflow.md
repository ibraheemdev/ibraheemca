The Rust compiler is known to be annoying. Sometimes, even trying to do the simplest thing will result in a compile time error. However, this is for good reason. Rust's borrow checker guarantees memory and thread-safety â€” enabling you to eliminate many classes of bugs at compile-time. In this article, I am going to try to create the strictest (most annoying) Rust workflow, making your code more idiomatic with [clippy](#clippy), safer with [miri](#miri), and more consistent with [rustfmt](#formatting).

## Building

The first step in our workflow is a simple `cargo check` with all the targets and features enabled:
```rust
$ cargo check --all-targets --all-features
```


## Clippy

Clippy is a community driven linter that helps catch common mistakes and improve your Rust code. For example, try linting this little program:
```rust
fn main() {
    let msg = "Hello";
    if msg.len() > 0 {
        println!("{}", msg)
    }
}
```
And clippy will complain:
```rust
error: length comparison to zero
 --> src/main.rs:3:8
  |
3 |     if msg.len() > 0 {
  |        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ help: using `!is_empty` is clearer and more explicit: `!msg.is_empty()`
  |
```
Clippy has a couple of configuration options that can make it stricter. For starters, we can tell it to check all targets and activate all features:
```rust
$ cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features
```
Now let's get into the configuration for the actual linting. 

Clippy has four lint levels:
```rust
-W --warn OPT       Set lint warnings
-A --allow OPT      Set lint allowed
-D --deny OPT       Set lint denied
-F --forbid OPT     Set lint forbidden
```
The strictest level is `forbid`. However, the forbid level is pretty limited. For example, let's say that you have a specific reason to use `.len() > 0` instead of `!is_empty`. With the `deny` lint level, you can explicitly tell clippy to not lint that comparison:
```rust
#[allow(clippy::len_zero)]
fn main() {
    let msg = "Hello";
    if msg.len() > 0 {
        println!("{}", msg)
    }
}
```
But with `forbid`, Clippy will override your `allow`, and still fail the lint check. For the purposes of this article, we'll stick with the `forbid` level, but for most use cases, `deny` is probably a better option. 

Clippy has linting *categories*. For example, `clippy:pedantic` enables the *really* strict lints, `clippy:cargo` tells clippy to check your manifest file, and `clippy:all` enables everything else. You can also tell clippy to fail when encountering warnings with `--forbid warnings`.

There is one more lint category, and that is `clippy::nursery`. These are lints that are in a *beta*, or unreleased stage.

Let's go ahead and enable all the available clippy lints at the `forbidden` lint level. Here is the final clippy command:
```rust
$ cargo clippy \
  --all-targets \
  --all-features \
  -- \
  --forbid warnings \
  --forbid clippy::all \
  --forbid clippy::pedantic \
  --forbid clippy::cargo \
  --forbid clippy::nursery
```

## Testing:

Testing in Rust is pretty straightforward. The most we can do here, is test all the compile targets, and enable all features:
```rust
$ cargo test --all-targets --all-features
```

## Formatting

Rustfmt is a tool for formatting Rust code according to style guidelines. It has hundreds of [configuration options](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/blob/master/Configurations.md) that can be set with a config file, or throught the command line. By default, it uses a style which conforms to the [Rust style guide](https://github.com/rust-dev-tools/fmt-rfcs/blob/master/guide/guide.md) that has been formalized through the [style RFC
process](https://github.com/rust-dev-tools/fmt-rfcs). We'll stick to the default formatting options for this article, but there are some other options we can enable. 

We can tell Rustfmt to format all packages (in a workspace):
```rust
$ cargo fmt --all
```

In the context of a CI workflow, you probably don't want rustfmt writing to the file system. Instead, we can tell it to run in 'check' mode, which exits with 0 if input is formatted correctly, and exits with 1 and prints a diff if formatting is required.
```rust
$ cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

## Miri

Miri is an experimental interpreter for [ust's
[mid-level intermediate representation](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1211-mir.md).  It can run binaries and
test suites of cargo projects and detect certain classes of
[undefined behavior](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html),
for example:

* Out-of-bounds memory accesses and use-after-free
* Invalid use of uninitialized data
* Not sufficiently aligned memory accesses and references

On top of that, Miri will also tell you about memory leaks: when there is memory
still allocated at the end of the execution, and that memory is not reachable
from a global `static`, Miri will raise an error.

Miri has already discovered some [real-world bugs](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/blob/master/README.md#bugs-found-by-miri) in the standard library! It is an amazing tool that is perfect for our workflow.

As of now, Miri is only available on the nightly release channel. For a CI workflow, that is totally fine, as we can install the latest nightly release and run Miri with nightly enabled within the workflow:
```rust
$ MIRI_NIGHTLY=nightly-$(curl -s https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup-components-history/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/miri)
$ rustup set profile minimal
$ rustup default "$MIRI_NIGHTLY"
$ rustup component add miri
```

Now you can run your test suite with the miri interpreter:
```rust
$ cargo miri test
```

As you probably guessed, Miri has a few configuration options that we can set to make our workflow even stricter. These can be enabled with the `MIRIFLAGS` environment variable:
```rust
export MIRIFLAGS="-Zmiri-symbolic-alignment-check -Zmiri-track-raw-pointers"
cargo miri test
```

The `symbolic-alignment-check` flag makes the alignment check more strict, and `track-raw-pointers` makes Stacked Borrows track a pointer tag even for raw pointers.

## Conclusion

That's all for our workflow. As you can tell, Rust's tooling is amazing! There are many official cargo components that you can use to make development easier.
